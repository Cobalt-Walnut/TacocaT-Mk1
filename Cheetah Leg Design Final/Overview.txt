This is the final iteration of the Mk1 TacocaT leg design. It's a four-bar linkage for simplicity
because all angles inputted into the motor are directly outputted into the lower leg. This makes 
coding the leg trajectory easier because of the 1:1 ratio on the angles.

All parts were printed on the Ender 5 Pro 3d printer with a usable build plate size of 220×220×300mm.
Some of the parts had to be split to fit on the Ender 5 Pro. They would be joined together using
a woodworking technique called 'Sashimono'.
